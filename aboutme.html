    <p>My name is Devin Kothari, age 14, 10th grade. I am in the Computer Sceince Principles class, with Mr. Kim as the teacher.  
    What I like to do I play Video Games which most younger kids get into, my favorite Video Game is Tom  Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, which I think is a good game. 
    I also watch Anime my favorite show is Sword Art Online and after Danmachi(Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon) do not judge me from this last show I just mentioned. 
    I played the trumpet in 6th and 7th grade, I used to play the guitar when I was 6 years old. I used to dance when i was 7 and 8 I was in a competition I don't recall whcih position we came in.
